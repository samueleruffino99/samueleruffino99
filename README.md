# Ciao a tutti! 👋 I'm [Your Name]

Hello folks! I am samuele Ruffino, and I have started my engineer journey in back 2018. I have graduated in **Politecnico di Torino** in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** with 108/110.
I am currently having my MSc in **Electrical Engineering and Information Technology** at **ETH Zurich**, with a particular focus on Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 
No more "engineering", promise!

Here's a bit about my academic and professional journey:

- 🔬 I did my semester thesis between IBM Research and IIS ETHZ Lab in Symbolic AI, focusing on Neuro Vector Symbolic Architecture. 

- 🚗 I had the opportunity to have an internship at BMW Group, where I worked on 6D pose estimation and synthetic data generation.

- 🎓 Currently, I am working on my master thesis at CVL, focusing on human motion estimation for object tracking.

## 🔧 Tools and Skills I had to use in the last years

- Python
- Pytorch
- Tensorflow (light or not)
- Numpy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit Learn
- Tensorboard

## 🍻 Interests

Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a keen interest in Arts (G. De Chirico is the best, change my mind), Sport, Cinema and Cooking.
